# stitches
Amalgamate existing climate data to create monthly climate variable fields.

## Getting Started Using `stitches`
Jupyter notebooks hosted on `stitches` use functionality that is contained within the accompanying Python package.  

**NOTE:**  Ensure you are using Python >= 3.6.  Calling `python` may use a different instance.  Some users may need to use `python3` or the like instead.

#### For developers
Clone the repository and then install the package in development mode using from inside the package's root directory:
```bash
python setup.py develop
```

#### For users
To install for use, run the following:
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/JGCRI/stitches.git
```
