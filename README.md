## Getting Started Using `stitches`
Jupyter notebooks hosted on `stitches` use functionality that is contained within the accompanying Python package.  

**NOTE:**  Ensure you are using Python >= 3.6.  Calling `python` may use a different instance.  Some users may need to use `python3` or the like instead.

`stitches`  users and devlopers agree to must agree to our community guidelines outlines in our [contirbutors guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Open an issue to ask for help or report an issue ([how to open a github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)).

```bash
python setup.py develop
```
